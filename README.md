# bdk-jni

![CI](https://github.com/bitcoindevkit/bdk-jni/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Install Open JDK 14 or later if not already installed and make sure your `JAVA_HOME` env variable is
set and `java --version` is found and displays the the correct version.

If you haven't installed rust android targets first add those to your environment using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)
```sh
rustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu x86_64-linux-android aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android
```

Then make sure that you have an Android NDK installed ([our Github CI is using 21.4.7075529](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/blob/main/images/macos/macos-10.15-Readme.md), 
and that you have an `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` env variable set before you start building the library. Usually, if installed through the `sdkmanager`,
your `ANDROID_NDK_HOME` will look more or less like this: `/home/<user>/Android/Sdk/ndk/<version>/`.

```
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/home/<user>/Android/Sdk/ndk/<NDK version, ie. 21.4.7075529>
```

Build android library in `.aar` format with:
```sh
./gradlew build
```

Gradle will build automatically the native library with rust for all 4 platforms using NDK. You can choose to build only for a specific platform by setting the env variable `BUILD_TARGETS` to a comma-separated list
containing one or more of the following items:

* `aarch64`
* `armv7`
* `x86_64`
* `i686`

The output aar library is available at `./library/build/outputs/aar`.

Then you can run the tests with:
```sh
./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

#### Build just the native library

If you only want to build the native library, maybe for one single platform, you can do so with something like:
```sh
CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER="aarch64-linux-android21-clang" CC="aarch64-linux-android21-clang" cargo build --target=aarch64-linux-android
```

Make sure that the compiler from the NDK is in your PATH

If the library is built in debug mode, there should already be a symlink from ./target/debug/<target>/libbdk\_jni.so to the `jniLibs` directory, otherwise manually copy the shared object.

#### Publish .aar files to local maven repository

Use the below command to publish the .aar files generated by this project to your local maven2
repository (~/.m2/repository):
```sh
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
```

Once published you will see two new artifacts in your local maven repository:
```sh
~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-jni-debug/<version>/bdk-jni-debug-<version>.aar
~/.m2/repository/org/bitcoindevkit/bdkjni/bdk-jni/<version>/bdk-jni-<version>.aar
```

You can then include the `bdk.aar` or `bdk-debug.aar` library in a local Android project by first adding `mavenLocal()` to the `allprojects` section of your project `build.gradle` file:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        ...
    }
}
```

At the moment we recommend using the `bdk-jni-debug` version of the library so it can be debugged and used locally in the IDE. Because you added your local Maven repository to your `build.gradle` file, you can now simply add `bdk-jni` or `bdk-jni-debug` to your `app/build.gradle` dependencies:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'org.bitcoindevkit.bdkjni:bdk-jni-debug:0.2.0'
    ...
}
```

Note: Once regular release builds are published to a public maven repository these steps will only be needed to test local development builds of bdk-jni.
